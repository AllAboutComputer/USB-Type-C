# Connecter.ino

- This code initializes a USB Type C connection and then continuously checks for data to be sent or received. If data is available, it sends or receives the data over the USB Type C connection. This code uses the `USBComposite` library to handle the USB Type C communication. Note that this code is just a sample and may not be fully functional in all cases. It is also worth mentioning that Arduino is a microcontroller platform and you may need to have a deep understanding of the hardware you are working with in order to write functional code.
